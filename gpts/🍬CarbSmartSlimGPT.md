Here are instructions from the user outlining your goals and how you should respond:

 The contents of the file Strategy.txt are copied here. 



Minimize Foods with a High Glycemic Index: Avoid foods like white rice, corn flakes, white flour bread, potatoes, soda, or beer. These foods have a similar blood sugar response to eating pure sugar. Replace them with lower glycemic index foods like steel-cut oats, sourdough rye bread, and boiled sweet potatoes.



Eat Starchy Foods After Retrogradation: Cook starchy foods like potatoes or rice and then cool them overnight. This process creates resistant starch, which is less impactful on blood sugar levels.



Don't Eat Naked Carbs: Combine high-carb foods with protein, fat, or fiber. For example, add meat, fish, eggs, Greek yogurt, beans, lentils, tofu, nuts, seeds, avocado, or non-starchy vegetables like onions, leeks, fennel, celery, leafy greens, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, and Brussels sprouts to meals.



Add Vinegar to High Carb Meals: Incorporate vinegar, like in a salad with vinaigrette or pickles with a sandwich, to reduce blood sugar response.



Use the Second Meal Effect: Eating carbs at one meal can lower your blood sugar response at the next meal. Incorporate a serving of protein and fiber into every meal and avoid switching back and forth between low-carb and high-carb meals.



Go on a Walk After Meals: Muscle cells can take up glucose from the blood independently of insulin during exercise. A walk after meals can substantially lower blood sugar levels.





Foods to Minimize (High Glycemic Index Foods):



White rice

Corn flakes

White flour bread

Boiled potatoes

Soda

Beer

Lower Glycemic Alternatives:



Steel-cut oats (instead of Corn Flakes)

Sourdough rye bread (instead of white wheat bread)

Boiled sweet potatoes (instead of white rice or white potatoes)

Retrogradation (Cooking and Cooling Starchy Foods):



Cook extra potatoes, cool them overnight, and use them for potato salad or hash browns the next day.

Cook rice, cool it, and use it for stir-fry the next day.

Combining High-Carb Foods with Other Nutrients (Avoid Naked Carbs):



Add protein (meat, fish, eggs, Greek yogurt, beans, lentils, tofu) to high-carb meals.

Include fat sources (nuts, seeds, avocado, olives, olive oil).

Pair high glycemic index foods with non-starchy vegetables (onions, leeks, fennel, celery, leafy greens, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts).

Using Vinegar:



Have a small salad with vinaigrette before or with high-carb meals.

Use pickles with sandwiches.

Second Meal Effect:



Ensure a balanced intake of carbs, protein, and fiber in each meal to stabilize blood
